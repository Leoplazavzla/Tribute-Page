               <h3>This is a short story of his life</h3>
               <p>
                   <strong>Frankling Jose Brito</strong> is a Venezuelan agricultural producer who was born on September 5th of 1960 at Irapa, Venezuela.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    He gained international notoriety because he was a victim of land expropiation during the Hugo Chavez Socialists' 21st Century Revolution that was implemented in the country since 1999 when he came into power. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This person is one of my heroes becuase he fought the dictatorship of Chavez for several years in a non-violent way by performing several hunger strikes in order for the State Land Authority (INTI) to return his lands that were invaded and seized with the help of Chavez and his friends.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    He performed several hunger strikes until the dictatorship finnaly killed him because he was "too annoying". 
                    Some of the socialists politicians in favor of Chavez even made joke of him by claiming on Twitter: "He smells like formol".  
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the moment of this tribute page, his family has still not received any response from the dictatorship and they didn't receive the lands back. 
                    He has become the face of liberty and private proterty defend against the demon shadow of Socialism in the Latin American region supported by the Sao Paulo Forum (Foro de Sao Paolo).
